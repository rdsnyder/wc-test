# Oakleaf Hydrangea

Hydrangea quercifolia, commonly known as oakleaf hydrangea or <span data-click-image-zoomto="2929,2317,387,449">oak-leaved hydrangea</span>, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hydrangeaceae.[2] It is native to the southeastern United States, in woodland habitats from North Carolina west to Tennessee, and south to Florida and Louisiana.[3] A deciduous shrub with white showy flower heads, it is grown as a garden plant, with numerous cultivars available commercially.

Its specific epithet combines the Latin words quercus ("oak"), and folium ("leaf"). However, it is not closely related to oak species (Quercus).

## Description

Hydrangea quercifolia is a coarse-textured deciduous shrub growing to 3–12 feet (0.91–3.66 m)[4] tall with an open crown. The plant sprouts shoots from underground stolons and often grows in colonies. Young stems are covered in a felt-like light brown bark, and the larger stems have attractive cinnamon-tan-orange bark that shreds and peels in thin flakes.

The leaves are yellowish green to dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. They have three, five or seven pointed lobes and are 4–12 in (10.2–30.5 cm) long and almost as wide. They vaguely resemble larger versions of oak leaves, similar to Quercus species with lobed foliage. Plants in shade have larger leaves than those grown in sun. The leaves turn rich shades of red, bronze and purple in autumn that persist in winter accompanying the persistent dried flower-heads.

## Flowers

Hydrangea quercifolia flowers are borne in erect panicles 6–12 in (15.2–30.5 cm) tall and 3–5 in (7.6–12.7 cm) wide at branch tips. Flowers age in colour from creamy white, aging to pink and by autumn and winter are a dry, papery rusty-brown.

Unlike bigleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea macrophylla), flower color does not vary with soil pH.
